      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly a “Thank You” to you all for your support in 2019. This means that we start 2020 with a total of £21,000 raised so far, towards the building of the new hut. The target is £250,000 and we hope to raise much of this during 2020 so please please please spare a few minutes to read this newsletter and support wherever you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All support is appreciated, whether it be the donation of a raffle prize, baking a cake, helping out at an event or joining the fund-raising team. All help is very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/hutplan.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hut Plan&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the plan for our new scout building. We are looking for local groups who would be interested in using the hall during daytimes, weekends and holidays. Or maybe to use the availability of the hall to start a new group in Nanpantan. If you know of any groups, please message me and I will make contact. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
