title: January Fundraising Update
---

Firstly a “Thank You” to you all for your support in 2019. This means that we start 2020 with a total of £21,000 raised so far, towards the building of the new hut. The target is £250,000 and we hope to raise much of this during 2020 so please please please spare a few minutes to read this newsletter and support wherever you can.  

All support is appreciated, whether it be the donation of a raffle prize, baking a cake, helping out at an event or joining the fund-raising team. All help is very much appreciated.  

Keep up to date with it all by joining our Facebook site https://www.facebook.com/NanpantanScouts 

# So what has happened since our last update? 

## Santa fun run - £702 

During early December a team of 16 successfully completed the Loughborough Santa Run, raising a fantastic £700 in sponsorship. Great fun was had by all. Thanks to all our runners.   

## November working day at the hut - £60

During the working day at the hut, we uncovered a number of unwanted ‘treasures’ which we managed to sell via social media, raising £60. Every little helps! 

# And now…..? 

## Music Magpie 

Two of our Scouts, Euan and Matthew, have come up with the great idea of selling unwanted CDs via Music Magpie to help raise funds. Please do have a new year clear out and drop any unwanted CDs into the collection box at the hut, and they will do the rest. Couldn’t be easier for you!  

## Smarties tubes from Father Christmas 

Father Christmas kindly gifted a tube of smarties to every Beaver, Cub and Scout just before Christmas. The content will have long since been eaten no doubt! But please do remember his request to fill the tube with any loose change and donate it, into the collection box in the hut. 20p’s fit just right! 

And a great way to get on the 2020 Nice List already
