**Can I bring a bouncy castle?** Yes! Bouncy castles and inflatables are allowed both inside and outside (maximum size 5m x 5m, height 4m). Outside inflatables must be positioned to minimise intrusion to neighbors and deflated by 9pm. You must ensure proper supervision and the supplier provides suitable insurance. 

**Can I serve alcohol at my event?** You cannot sell alcohol without a Temporary Event Licence from Charnwood Borough Council. Alcohol consumption by persons under 18 is not permitted.

**Is smoking allowed?** No smoking or vaping is permitted anywhere in the building, including e-cigarettes. 

**Can I use decorations?** Bunting and balloons can be attached with string to the hooks in the main hall. You must not use blue tack, sellotape, drawing pins or similar items on the building fabric. Glitter and confetti can be used inside but must be fully cleaned up at the end of your hire. 

**Are pets allowed?** No animals (including birds) are allowed except guide dogs, unless agreed for a special event. Assistance dogs are permitted but cannot enter the kitchen area.

**What items are not permitted?** Fireworks are not permitted at any time. Smoke, foam, or bubble-making machines are also not allowed. Disposable barbecues are prohibited. 

**What are my responsibilities at the end of hire?** You must leave the premises clean and tidy, close all doors and windows, switch off lights and appliances, return keys to the key safe, and take all rubbish away with you (recycling can go in the external bin if not full). Your deposit will be returned within 5 working days once these conditions are met. 

**Do I need insurance?** Yes, hirers are responsible for arranging insurance against any third-party claims whilst using the building. The Scout Group is insured against claims arising from its own negligence only.
