What a weekend! We’re thrilled to announce the official grand opening of our brand-new scout hut on Saturday, 13th September. This new building marks a huge milestone for the 1st Nanpantan Scout Group, and we couldn't be more excited to welcome our young people and the wider community into our new home.

The day was a huge success, filled with members of our community, local leaders, councillors, and all the amazing people who have supported us on this journey. The Mayor of Charnwood, Councillor David Northage, and Councillor Jennifer Tillotson from Charnwood Borough Council joined us for the official ribbon-cutting ceremony. It was a proud moment for all of us to finally open the doors after so much hard work.

This project was a true community effort. Over the past 12 months, we've watched our new hut rise from the ground after saying goodbye to the two original buildings that served as our home for over 70 years.

We are incredibly grateful for the support we received, including a significant £65,000 grant from the Government’s UK Shared Prosperity Fund, secured through Charnwood Borough Council. This funding, along with countless hours of volunteer work and generous donations, made our dream a reality.

As our Group Scout Leader, Carl Travis-Roberts, said on the day, "This new hut is more than just a building; it’s a home for adventure, learning, and lifelong memories." We're looking forward to creating many more of those memories with the young people of Loughborough and the surrounding area.

Our new space will allow us to provide even better opportunities and activities for our Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, and Explorers. We're also excited to share that the facilities will be available for use by other local community groups.

We're so proud of what we've accomplished together and can't wait for what the future holds. A massive thank you to everyone who has supported us. This is just the beginning of our next great adventure!
