![Hut Plan](/img/hutplan.png)

This is the plan for our new scout building. We are looking for local groups who would be interested in using the hall during daytimes, weekends and holidays. Or maybe to use the availability of the hall to start a new group in Nanpantan. If you know of any groups, please message me and I will make contact. Thank you.
